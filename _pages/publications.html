    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11154">SLRNet: A Real-Time LSTM-Based Sign Language Recognition System</a>
  </h2>

  <p>
    Sign Language Recognition (SLR) plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap 
    between the hearing-impaired community and society. This paper introduces 
    <strong>SLRNet</strong>, a real-time webcam-based ASL recognition system using 
    MediaPipe Holistic and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model processes 
    video streams to recognize both ASL alphabet letters and functional words. With a 
    validation accuracy of <strong>86.7%</strong>, SLRNet demonstrates the feasibility 
    of inclusive, hardware-independent gesture recognition.
